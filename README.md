# AI-Chef
Final Project for UWO Datasci 3000 - Chef.AI

Uses Non-linear Regression to predict the Freshness Index (perceived freshness) of a food.
Uses the Freshness Index to return a recipe (using Groq) based on which foods expire fastest.

## Required Installations
In order to run the `.ipynb` file yourself, you must `pip install` each package imported at the top of the `.ipynb` file.
In order to train our model using your own data, or testing the model against your own test set, you must make a `.csv` file in the **same data format** as the `ourData.csv` and `ourDataTest.csv` files (all the brackets and square parentheses must be included!).
